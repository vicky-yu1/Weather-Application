3. [15] View results of prior searches via search history.
4. [20] User interfaces must look modern and be attractive.
5. [16] Allow for pagination of results returned by both searches.
6. [18] Allow cities returned in searches to be ranked by likes.
7. [16] Set the distance radius of both searches

We have appended all the features not attempted from sprint # 1's backlog 
because our stakeholders (CSCI 310 course producers) strongly suggested we
make progress on ALL items in the product backlog to get specific feedback 
regarding each requirement. We were unable to remove any features also present 
in sprint # 1's backlog because they are all yet to be fully completed, though 
we did gain valuable feed back on what those features entailed during the demo 
and are close to completing the distance radius search, pagination, and user 
interface features (# 4, 5, 7). Technical difficulties with setting up 
the SQL database impeded progress on features 2, 3, and 6, but those 
difficulties are resolved now.
