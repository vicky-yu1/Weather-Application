Sprint Backlog Items:
1. The application must be secure and protect confidentiality of users’ data.
2. Maintain users’ information beyond just a single session
3. View results of prior searches via search history.
4. User interfaces must look modern and be attractive.
5. Allow cities returned in searches to be ranked by likes.
6. Enhance security by enabling the application to be accessed via HTTPS.
7. Allow users to "like" cities and enable user to sort search results by likes.
8. Append a search history bar to the home page that will redisplay weather 
information upon clicking on a prior search history item.
9. Change the color scheme of the user interface for more contrast
10. Store the user's password's as hashes
11. Enable the user to log out of the application

All items on in the Sprint # 2 backlog were added to the product backlog for 
Sprint # 3 EXCEPT for the pagination and radius search features because they 
are complete. The first item (application must be secure) was not removed from 
the product backlog, even though items 6 and 10 detail its sub-features, because 
we are not confident if the product stakeholders provided us with all the 
relevant feedback corresponding the the first item. A similar logic applies to 
item 4 whose subtasks are detailed in items 7 and 10.

It is trivial to see that in the last sprint, ALL items on the product backlog 
must be in the sprint backlog given that this is the last opportunity to finish 
the implementation of those features. Essentially, we as a team decided that the 
product backlog and the sprint backlog will be equivalent sets of the same items 
for the last sprint.
