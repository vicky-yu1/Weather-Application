For Sprint#1, our team learned and executed the agile work flow for software engineering process. 
At first, we met on Zoom to plan the implementation schedule of each requirement in the project 
backlog and scheduled our following five scrum meeting. In Scrum meeting #1, we assigned task to 
every team members and set up Trello Broad to keep track of the work process. In all scrum meetings, 
everyone answered the three questions. Through the structured reporting system, and the update of 
Trello board, we keep everyone on the same page of the workflow. All scrum meetings are recorded in 
repo for your reference. Our team also learned and familiar ourselves with the git flow, including 
branch creation, merge, issue, and pull request. We also set up the development branch has a buffer, 
so that our unfinished feature would not interfere with the master branch. We implemented some features 
in Sprint #1, such as Radius Sort, Page Division, Design Mock Up, and login. We believe that we have 
set up at great model for agile work flow and accomplished the tasks we planned. We will keep up the 
good work for Sprint#2. Please let us know if there is anything we can improve on.
